  /// With certain kinds of input devices, such as a mouse with a scroll wheel that spins freely, it is easy to accidentally move the cursor
  /// over the slider and unintentionally change the playback position. For users that dislike this behavior IINA provides a setting to
  /// disable scrolling the slider. When this setting is enabled the user must grab and drag the slider's thumb to change the playback
  /// position or click on a position within the slider.
  /// - Parameter event: Event indicating the scroll wheel position changed.
